Title: Data people should strive to be folk singers, not rock stars

In early 2020, just before COVID-19 put a halt to in person events like this, I was invited to speak at the ["Data for the Greater Good"](https://www.meetup.com/greatergood/) meetup in New York. This vibrant community is open to all people interested in using data to tackle tricky social problems, and the organizers do a fantastic job. 

For better or worse, they let me talk about whatever I wanted, so I thought this would be a great opportunity to share some vague ideas that I've been having lately around the ways that data scientists in our field *actually* create positive change vs the ways that people typically assume they do. In practice, they tend to more closely resemble the collaborative, organic, bottom-up approach that folk musicians take in their creative process instead of the common "rock star" stereotype.

The full video of the talk, which digs into this analogy a bit more uses it as a vehicle for telling some stories about data at GlobalGiving, is below. Development Guild, one of the sponsors for the evening, also [wrote up a great blog post summary](https://www.developmentguild.com/meetup/data-greater-good-meetup-globalgiving/).

In addition, I spent probably more time than I needed to thinking of different musical examples of the kinds of creativity that I wanted to highlight. Of course, none of these made the final cut for the event, but I had too much fun not to share them. Eventually I'll write up some annotations for all the detailed reasons why I included each one, but in the meantime, here's the spotify playlist:
