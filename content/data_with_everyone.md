The UC Berkeley School of Information asked me to speak at the [DataEdge 2019 conference](https://dataedge.ischool.berkeley.edu/2019/speakers), so I took the chance to share some ideas about the importance of the unique power that data scientists have to shape the framing of questions in their organizations and to gently (but lovingly!) offer some alternatives to the concepts of "data for good".
